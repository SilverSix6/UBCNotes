- How to Clear Array
	1. Make a new Wild Class
	2. Have a method in Wild to clear (Could loop)
	3. Make helper method in Test

- It's bad to have a loop in a Unit Test, is it bad to use a Clear Loop in Wild Class that loops or since it is in a different file it is not subjected to that clause?

- Was the Array supposed to be made within the constructor or following the final variables.
	- If so then are we to expect the array size is always the default MAXX and MAXY set with the template `wild[2][4]`
